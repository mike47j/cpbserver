This show a list of the currently free targets and the first is selected. Choose any free target and enter it in the Target: box.

When entering a list of archers most of the details will stay the same until you change them. The age group for juniors can be set either by selecting from the gender drop down list or by selecting M or F and entering the date of birth.

When initially setting up a competition don't worry about mixing rounds on one target, that can be sorted out in the next step.
