The focus should be on the target entry box so just entering a target number on the keypad followed by enter should bring up the correct score sheet ready for entering the scores.

The target list and scores by name sorts by surname or club and team name if its a team competition.

Clicking the leader board uses the normal web page and not the secure one.
