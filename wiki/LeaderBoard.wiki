With a wifi connection to the network, anyone can get the leader board by connecting to the network and  entering the server address eg: http://192.168.1.64. For a scrolling large screen display then  http://192.168.1.64/scroll

The normal display is separate lists by round, gender and bow type, juniors are in the same list with a J after their name.

In our tournament Medals are given for shooting the round for your age (or longer). For Juniors as Gold, Silver and Bronze medals are given. For Seniors only Gold for 1 to 3 archers completing the round (DNS or retired not counting), Gold and Silver for 4 to 6 archers, Gold, Silver and Bronze for 7 or more archers. Since juniors are in the same result list as seniors the medals may not be the top 3 places in a list.

The junior championship was needed because we have trophies. Junior championship points are calculated as scores are entered. The score is divided by the Bowmen classification score for each age group and round and multiplying by 2000. Rounds without a bowmen classification score are calculated using the handicap for the bowmen classification.

The handicap leader board is calculated from the archers score + 1440 - 
the handicap score for the number of arrows shot so far.
