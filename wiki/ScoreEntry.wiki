[Contents Contents]

Currently there are 3 methods of score entry. Unfortunately, score sheets often have a few errors in the adding up. So I'm thinking that entering every arrow and having the system check the adding up will be the best system. I'll probably delete the other 2 methods if the first is not too much work for the runners.
 # Enter every arrow, checks adding up.
 # Enter every dozen score, small amount of checking.
 # Enter totals, no checking.

Single key entry of arrow scores, the enter key sends data and gets the next score sheet. T or + for 10, X or {{{*}}} for inner ten, 0 or M for miss. So the number pad can be used to enter the scores. If you make a mistake the backspace key will delete the last arrow entered. For Imperial rounds the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 are ignored. The Edit button allows small changes to be made to the Archers details.

Need to enter the dozen score, hits and golds, use tab to get to the next field and then tab followed by enter.
