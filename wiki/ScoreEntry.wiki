There are 3 methods of score entry:
 # Enter every arrow, checks adding up.
 # Enter every dozen score, small amount of checking.
 # Enter totals, no checking.

Single key entry of arrow scores, enter key send data and gets the next score sheet. T or + for 10, X or {{{*}}} for inner ten, 0 or M for miss. So the number pad can be used to enter the scores. If you make a mistake the backspace key will delete the last arrow entered. For Imperial rounds the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 are ignored.
