For Juniors as Gold, Silver and Bronze, Seniors only Gold for 1 to 3 archers completing the round (DNS or retired not counting), Gold and Silver for 4 to 6, Gold, Silver and Bronze for 7 or more. Juniors are in the same result list as seniors and have a J after their name, which means the medals may not be the top 3 places in the list.

Best Archer and Junior championship points calculated as scores are entered, by dividing the score by the Bowmen classification score for each age group and round and multiplying by 2000. Rounds without a bowmen classification score are calculated from the handicap for the bowmen classification.
