To get started enter the details in the boxes, and click submit. Most of the details should be obvious. It's probably best to set maximum targets to 1 or 2 more than needed. 

The medals checkbox allocates medals for a York/Hereford/Bristol tournament. Where medals are given for shooting the round for your age (or longer).  For Juniors as Gold, Silver and Bronze, Seniors only Gold for 1 to 3 archers completing the round (DNS or retired not counting), Gold and Silver for 4 to 6, Gold, Silver and Bronze for 7 or more. Juniors are in the same result list as seniors and have a J after their name, which means the medals may not be the top 3 places in the list.

The Best Archer and Junior championship checkboxes produce results tables which attempt to find the best with archers using different bows types and shooting different rounds. Points calculated from the scores as entered, divided by the Bowmen classification score score for the age group and round and multiplying by 2000. Rounds without a bowmen classification score are calculated from the handicap for the bowmen classification. 

The handicap and team checkboxes enable entry and results for handicap or team competitions.

The World Archery Rules changes the tie breaks for metric rounds.
|| *Round*         || *Tie Break 1* || *Tie Break 2* ||
|| AGB Imperial  || Hits    || Golds   ||
|| AGB Metric    || Hits    || X or 10 ||
|| AGB Worcester || Hits    || 5       ||
|| WA Metric     || X or 10 || X       ||

There are 3 methods for the score entry system, either enter every arrow value, the dozen totals, or just totals.

Click submit to store the information in the server. This will be written to the "data.csv" file after about 20 seconds.

There is some test data so you can skip clearing everything and adding archers to see how the program works. “Clear Everything” will delete all information and go into “Add Archers”. Don't worry about mixing rounds on one target yet, that can be sorted out in the next step.

Targets by round will give a list of the rounds and targets, for the test data it will show a lot of errors with mixed rounds on targets.

Then use [Allocate “Re-allocate Targets”] to un-mix the rounds and get all longbows together etc. Just click in a list to move an entry from one side to the other or leave a target empty.

After that {{{http://192.168.1.64:4023/index}}} is the data entry start page.
